Legend has it that the valley of 
Kashmir was once a large lake. In it 
lived a demon who was killed after 
the lake was drained with the help of 
Brahmaâs grandson, Kashyap, and the 
Goddess Parvati. Parvati is supposed 
to have killed the demon by dropping 
a mountain on him. This legendary 
mountain is believed to be Takht-i-
Sulaiman â also called Shankaracharya 
hill â and forms the familiar backdrop 
to the city of Srinagar.
History and myth, language and 
literature, art and architecture, culture 
and tradition are distinctive to the 
people of Kashmir, but these aspects 
are also closely intertwined with and 
integral to the story of the Indian 
subcontinent. It was in this valley 
that Buddhism reached its zenith, 
Hinduism extended its frontiers into 
Shaivism and Shaktism, and Islam 
acquired a new meaning through

Waan in Kashmir means âshopâ. A 
wazwaan is literally, therefore, a cook 
shop or restaurant.
 In practice, however, the wazwaan

a feast served to an honoured guest. 
This lavish hospitality must be fully 
appreciated by the guest, for it is not
